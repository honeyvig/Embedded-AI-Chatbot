# Embedded-AI-Chatbot
Create an AI chatbot using botpress (or similar) to be embedded on a website, and converted into a telegram bot.

The chatbot will:
- Answer questions about how to use the product
- Give advice on error handling
- Suggest strategies/parameters to enter to optimise the performance of the product
-------------
To create an AI chatbot using Botpress (or a similar platform) and convert it into a Telegram bot, you need to set up the Botpress chatbot, embed it on a website, and then integrate it with Telegram. Below is a Python-based guide that will show you how to achieve this step-by-step.
Steps Overview:

    Set up Botpress locally or on a server.
    Build the chatbot on Botpress with intents and actions.
    Integrate the chatbot with a website using Botpress' web chat widget.
    Convert the chatbot into a Telegram bot using Botpress' Telegram integration.

1. Set Up Botpress Server

    First, you need to install Botpress on your local machine or a server. You can follow the official Botpress installation guide.

# Download Botpress
curl -L https://github.com/botpress/botpress/releases/download/12.26.0/botpress-12.26.0-linux-x64.tar.gz -o botpress.tar.gz
tar -xzvf botpress.tar.gz
cd botpress
./bp

Once the server is running, open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access the Botpress interface.
2. Build the Chatbot

    In the Botpress interface, create a new bot (e.g., ProductHelpBot).
    Define the necessary intents and actions:
        Intent: Create intents such as "product_usage", "error_handling", "optimization_tips".
        Actions: Implement actions that provide the corresponding responses, advice, and suggestions.

Example for Product Usage Intent in Botpress:

    Navigate to the Intents section in the Botpress interface and create a new intent named product_usage.
    Add user examples such as:
        "How do I use the product?"
        "Can you guide me through using the product?"
    Define the response for the intent, such as:

    To use the product, start by setting up [steps]. Please follow the instructions for the specific version you have.

For error handling and optimization, you can create similar intents like error_handling and optimization_tips, providing relevant guidance.
3. Embed the Bot on Your Website

    After building the chatbot, you can embed it on your website using the Botpress web chat widget.
    In Botpress, navigate to the Channel section, and choose Web to configure the web chat settings.
    Once the configuration is done, Botpress will give you a script to embed in your website's HTML.

Example HTML code to embed the bot:

<!-- Embed Botpress Web Chat -->
<script src="https://cdn.botpress.cloud/webchat/v0/inject.js"></script>
<script>
  window.botpressWebChat.init({
    botId: 'producthelpbot',
    host: 'http://localhost:3000', // Replace with your Botpress server URL
    messaging_url: 'http://localhost:3000', // Your Botpress server
  })
</script>

Add this HTML code to your website to display the chatbot.
4. Convert the Bot to a Telegram Bot

Botpress makes it easy to convert your chatbot to a Telegram bot. You will need to set up a Telegram bot and configure it in Botpress.
4.1 Set Up a Telegram Bot:

    Create a Telegram Bot: Open the Telegram app and search for the BotFather bot. Use the /newbot command to create a new bot and get the API token.

    Save the Telegram Token: You will use this token to connect Botpress to Telegram.

4.2 Configure Botpress for Telegram:

    In the Botpress interface, go to the Channels section.
    Click on Telegram to configure it.
    Add your Telegram bot's token in the configuration field.

Example configuration (make sure your Botpress instance is accessible to Telegram, and you've installed necessary Telegram modules in Botpress):

{
  "token": "YOUR-TELEGRAM-BOT-TOKEN",
  "enabled": true,
  "webhook_url": "https://your-server-url.com/api/v1/bots/PRODUCTHELPBOT/telegram/webhook"
}

4.3 Set Up the Webhook (Optional for Production):

For Botpress to receive messages from Telegram, ensure that your server has HTTPS enabled (to comply with Telegram's security standards). The webhook URL needs to be publicly accessible.
5. Python Code for Handling Incoming Messages (Optional)

You may want to use Python for handling additional logic such as sending personalized messages or logging user interactions with the Telegram bot.
Example Python Script for Telegram Bot Integration:

import requests
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

# Set your bot's token here
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = 'YOUR-TELEGRAM-BOT-TOKEN'

# Function to send message to Telegram bot
def send_message(chat_id, text):
    url = f'https://api.telegram.org/bot{TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/sendMessage'
    payload = {
        'chat_id': chat_id,
        'text': text
    }
    requests.post(url, data=payload)

# Webhook endpoint for Telegram
@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    data = request.json
    chat_id = data['message']['chat']['id']
    user_message = data['message']['text']
    
    # Here you can add logic to analyze the user's message or pass it to Botpress
    response_message = f'You said: {user_message}. How can I assist you?'

    # Send message back to user
    send_message(chat_id, response_message)
    return '', 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)

In this Flask example, the webhook receives incoming messages from Telegram, processes them, and sends back a response. You can extend this script to include more logic, such as interacting with Botpress for responses or handling specific user requests.
Conclusion:

With these steps, you can:

    Create a chatbot on Botpress to handle product usage, error handling, and optimization advice.
    Embed the chatbot into your website using Botpress' web chat widget.
    Convert the chatbot into a Telegram bot, allowing users to interact with it on both platforms.

This setup ensures that your chatbot provides valuable, real-time support for users, both on your website and via Telegram.
